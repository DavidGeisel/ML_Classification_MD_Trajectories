Accompanying repository for the paper: "Machine Learning Classification of Trajectories from Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Chromosome Segregation"

**Content**: Machine learning models for the classification of different modes of replication and segregation in bacteria.


## Documentation
- the trained models and their corresponding train and test sets should be copied to ML-models/
- they can be downloaded from [this](https://data.uni-marburg.de/handle/dataumr/135) repository

- scripts to evaluate the models and reproduce the results mentioned in the paper are stored in [evaluation/](https://github.com/DavidGeisel/ML_Classification_MD_Trajectories/tree/main/evaluation)
	- classification results for the complete trajectories can be reproduced with the notebook in [complete-trajectories/](https://github.com/DavidGeisel/ML_Classification_MD_Trajectories/tree/main/evaluation/complete-trajectories)
	- classification results for short trajectories can be reproduced with the notebook in [short-trajectories/](https://github.com/DavidGeisel/ML_Classification_MD_Trajectories/tree/main/evaluation/short-trajectories)
